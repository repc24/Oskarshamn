    "    * *Why?* --> In the future, the model could be adapted to be compiled and to describe different kinds of and setups of energy systems with different technologies\n",
    "* Be mindful of how the data is loaded and called in the model to avoid integration errors (like the previous error with numpy)\n",
    "* Convert the model to kW (previously MW) to avoid issues/error with integer to float conversion\n",
    "* *OBS*: SoC[*t*] needs a previous value, so we need to artificially override the initial SoC (or implement an SoC for *t* = -1)\n",
    "* In future implementations/improvements, try converting the time-step to seconds/minutes.\n",
    "    * *Reason* is to have a more realistic dispatch profile where BESS can charge and discharge in the same hour\n",
    "* To keep in mind for validation\n",
    "    * I could also run it with different curtailment penalties and see their effect\n",
    "    * Underlying difference in optimisation problem when optimising only each time-step vs. optimising a time series window"
